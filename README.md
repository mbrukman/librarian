# Librarian

Easily find free, fully-readable and/or downloadable books via Google Books API.
Upon finding a book, you can view it online using the Google Books HTML reader,
or download it for your ebook reader.

See the [live demo](https://mbrukman.github.io/librarian/), or clone this
repository and then open `index.html` in your browser to try it out.

## Alternatives

You can also use [Google Books: Advanced
Search](https://books.google.com/advanced_book_search) which provides even more
parameters to searching books, and includes magazines and newspapers.

That said, working on this project let me use Google Books API and create a
custom result visualization with additional links for reading content that I
could customize, and it defaults to fully-accessible books (public domain / out
of copyright), which is what I wanted to see. Plus, it was fun to build!
